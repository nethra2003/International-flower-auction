International Flower Auction is a web-based platform that simulates the dynamic environment of global flower trading. Designed to streamline the auction process, this system connects flower growers, buyers, and auctioneers in real-time, enabling efficient bidding and transparent transactions. The platform supports live bidding, product listings with detailed specs, and price tracking for various flower types across international markets. Ideal for showcasing how technology can modernize traditional agricultural markets, this project demonstrates the integration of real-time data handling, user interaction, and scalable architecture.
